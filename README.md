Hello, my name is Nivesh Shrestha, and this project is my submission for the FZTPL – Junior Frontend Developer (ReactJS) Technical/Domain Round. For this assignment, I built a React application that fetches user data from the public API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
 and displays it in a clean, structured, and responsive interface. I implemented a real-time search/filter feature to instantly update the results, and the project demonstrates key React concepts such as useState, useEffect, proper component organization, and reusable UI elements. I also added a loading indicator and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience. The application runs without issues in both the local environment and CodeSandbox. All required files, links, and the README have been included as instructed. Task Completed: Yes.
